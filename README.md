# Aerial

Alright Aerial is my bullet hell shooter type of project. I am makeing this in Godot and I purely want to focus on the bullets and patterns of the bullets.

Once I am satisfied by the system I have in place for the bullets I want to extend this into a full demo of the different mechanics.

This is the third (and hopefully the last) attempt to make this game.
